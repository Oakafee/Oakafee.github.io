subtitle: Why Not?

<p>Celebrated New Jersey author and chronicler of our state's culture Junot DÃ­az succinctly identifies "..a particularly Jersey malaise--the inextinguishable longing for elsewheres." Many of us have to admit to falling prey to this discontent: rich and poor; urban, suburban and rural alike. We seek life paths, or at least vacations, which transcend the boundaries of our state (as I have done intermittently). We choose to identify with a place other than where we are, be it New York City, New England, or another part of the world to which we have some connection. Our actual home is a cramped, developmentally nightmarish state with one of the highest costs of living in the US, a shamelessly apparent gap between the lives of the rich and poor, laughably crooked politics, and a general lack of cultural and social cohesion. </p>

<p>You can't choose where you come from. But why not love that place, if you can? A basic, organic connection to somewhere is a powerful, beautiful, irreplacable part of life. The people are your people, the highways your highways, the hills your hills, by birthright. The creation of this website is an act of love, or rather an assertion of love. And New Jersey in particular needs to be shown more love, and taken for granted less. </p>

<p>And there are even elements of New Jersey which it is easy to love. </p>

<p>Just because you love someone doens't mean you can't criticize them, though. Quite the contrary, actually. </p>
