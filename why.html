<p>If the editors of this website were Evangelical Christians, it would be easy for us to say that its purpose is to glorify God through praise of God's creation, the state of New Jersey. However, since many of us (myself included) lack the worldview, cultural context, and, one might assert, the divine grace to really accept Jesus Christ, we will have to break down that phrase into more earthy, atheist-friendly chunks. </p>

<p>Here we sing our love for New Jersey. </p>

<p>It is a complicated place to love, as this world in general can be hard to love. The first taste isn't always the sweetest, so to speak. What New Jerseyite hasn't felt, on the way home after some trip out of state, on a grey day, looking at a bleak neighborhood or industrial park or highway interchange, a reflex of revulsion? </p>

<p>More than isolated moments of disgust, many of us waste away years of our lives in what the great latter day chronicler of life in our state, Junot DÃ­az, refers to as "a particularly Jersey malaise--the inextinguishable longing for elsewheres."  It is a sad reality that many of us psychologically leave home, even if we're physically still there. We like to feel like we are in New Jersey but not of it. Many of us have clear reasons for the detachment, like being homesick immigrants, or harboring aspirations that will take us abroad, but even the most rooted, immobile New Jerseyites have some admittedly compelling reasons for escapism. It can be difficult to face the reality that home is a cramped, developmentally nightmarish state with one of the highest costs of living in the US, a shamelessly apparent gap between the lives of the rich and poor, laughably crooked politics, and a general lack of cultural and social cohesion. </p>

<p>These complaints, relevant as they are to New Jersey, are certainly not limited to New Jersey. To dislike New Jersey for these reasons is, in some ways, like hating it because Agent Orange was manufactured in our chemical plants, or because the crude oil arrives here directly from the cruel and duplicitous regimes we buy it from. You can leave New Jersey and get farther away from these things, but it's very hard to be free of them. <b>In New Jersey, many realities - of our system, of our world, of human nature - are unusually visible, by virtue of our density, our diversity, our location, our history. </b> This distinction is, in itself, something to be proud of. </p>

<p>Is it possible to love a place like this? Spontaneously, irrationally, my heart leaps up vigorously to scream "yes!" Since the reader may not wish to trust me implicitly, let's turn to an outside authority. In this case, an authority on love and appreciation of the world: the great colonial American theologian Jonathan Edwards. In his philosophical <i>The Nature of True Virtue</i>, Edwards speaks of "a beauty of order in society...We have an example when the members of society all have their appointed job, position and rank according to their various abilities and talents, and everyone keeps his place and continues in his proper business." In our own mess of inequality, exploitation and general disunity adjacent to the epicenter of late-stage post-Industrial captialism, is there anything beautiful left to appreciate? It may be uncertain, but we're sure as hell going to look for it. </p>

<p>It's almost true that to hate New Jersey is to hate the world; to love New Jersey is to love the world. With the right approach - through an honest appraisal of what's going on here, a sympathetic look at the state's history, an attempt at a broad scope beyond the perspective of any one individual or group - we hope we can interpret New Jersey and show you the love that's there to be found. I know it's there: I've experienced it. The only trick is communicating it, and doing so in a way that seems true. We are not going to sugarcoat New Jersey. </p>
