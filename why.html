title: Why Does This Site Exist?
subtitle: Why Not?
---

You can't choose where you come from. But why not love that place, if you can? A basic, organic connection to somewhere is a powerful, beautiful, irreplacable part of life. The people are your people, the hills are your hills, by birthright. The creation of this website is an act of love, or rather an assertion of love. And New Jersey in particular needs to be shown more love, and taken for granted less. 

Just because you love someone doens't mean you can't criticize them, though. Quite the contrary, actually.
