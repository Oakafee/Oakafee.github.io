<p><This map shows patterns of land use, painted in fairly broad strokes, in the portion of NJ I am most familiar with. See below for an idea of how these categories extend into the rest of the state. "Urban Neibhorhoods with Suburban Qualities" refers to probably the Jersiest style of development: a compromise between city life and the suburban compromise. To make everything a little simpler, we'll break all of this info into only a few land-use categories, with "Jersey style" thrown into the "Urban core."  </p>

<div class="table-container">
<table class="index">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://interpretation-of-nj.com/land-use/urban-core.html">Urban Core </a></td>
    <td><a href="http://interpretation-of-nj.com/land-use/suburbs.html">Suburbs </a></td>

<p>South and southwest of the map, intense development continues down the <a href="articles/turnpike.html">Turnpike</a> and <a href="articles/parkway.html">Parkway</a> corridors into <a href="articles/central-jersey">Central Jersey</a>. Industry lines the Arthur Kill and <a href="articles/raritan-river">Raritan</a>. Cities of this region include Woodbridge, Perth Amboy, New Brunswick and, further south along the shore, Long Branch and Asbury Park. Extensive suburbs surround them. As on the map, the suburbs are generally older and denser to the east, following the Raritan Bayshore and Atlantic Coast, and newer and more sprawling to the west. </p>

<p>In Central Jersey, suburbs extend west across the entire state, to the city of <a href="articles/trenton.html">Trenton</a> on the <a href="delaware-river">Delaware.</a> As you go south, the interior of the state becomes fairly rural. Vast military bases take advantate of this flat, open space. </p>

<p> South Jersey is another beast. The Philly suburbs are a smaller counterpart of the above map, centered around the small city of Camden, across the Delaware from Philly. There's a lot of farmland and the famous, largely undeveloped <a href="articles/pine-barrens.html">Pine Barrens</a> in the interior. The coast is developed mostly as resort towns. <a href="articles/ac.html">Atlantic City</a> is big and urban enough to have its own suburbs, sort of. </p>
