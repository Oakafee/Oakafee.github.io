<p><i> This map shows patterns of land use in the portion of NJ I am most intimately familiar with (someday I'll get around to a statewide one). As you can see, a rich history of development has created a complex, chaotic built environment, even on this map, which is painted in fairly broad strokes. In thematically categorizing the cities and towns, infrastructure, and other land use features of NJ, we have adopted the following simplified categories, with an understanding of their blurriness and analytical weakness. </i></p>

<p>South and southwest of the map, intense development continues down the <a href="articles/turnpike.html">Turnpike</a> and <a href="articles/parkway.html">Parkway</a> corridors into <a href="articles/central-jersey">Central Jersey</a>. Industry lines the Arthur Kill and <a href="articles/raritan-river">Raritan</a>. Cities of this region include Woodbridge, Perth Amboy, New Brunswick and, further south along the shore, Long Branch and Asbury Park. Extensive suburbs surround them. As on the map, the suburbs are generally older and denser to the east, following the Raritan Bayshore and Atlantic Coast, and newer and more sprawling to the west. </p>

<p>In Central Jersey, suburbs extend west across the entire state, to the city of <a href="articles/trenton.html">Trenton</a> on the <a href="delaware-river">Delaware.</a> As you go south, the interior of the state becomes fairly rural. Vast military bases take advantate of this flat, open space. </p>

<p> South Jersey is another beast. The Philly suburbs are a smaller counterpart of the above map, centered around the small city of Camden, across the Delaware from Philly. There's a lot of farmland and the famous, largely undeveloped <a href="articles/pine-barrens.html">Pine Barrens</a> in the interior. The coast is developed mostly as resort towns. <a href="articles/ac.html">Atlantic City</a> is big and urban enough to have its own suburbs, sort of. </p>
