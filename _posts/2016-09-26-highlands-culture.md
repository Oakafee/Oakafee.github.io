Hard to generalize.

According to legend, West of Morristown, in Morris County, is “horse country,” an affluent WASP stronghold spoken of with awe by new money white ethnic suburbanites. Philip Roth’s American Pastoral is a literary illustration of the cultural barrier between the immigrant hustle of the lowlands and the quaintness and social capital of the highlands. Even though this disctinction was always exaggerated and and is becoming increasingly less significant due to the effects of suburban sprawl and other general developments in American culture, I always felt a powerful longing growing up, when at a westward vantage point somewhere in the roads of my local Watchung Mountains, I would glimpse the slopes of the Highlands. Those hills seemed to hold the promies of a more meaningful life than I could have within Essex County, or maybe even in New York City. Perhaps I still labor under those delusions of social advancement. 


North and west of the Morris County enclaves, however, the indicators of wealth clearly drop off. A great visualization of this geosocial landscape is NJ.com’s map of million dollar homes in NJ. Passaic County, by virtue of its unusual shape, encompasses both gritty urban industrial centers (Paterson is its largest city) and Highlands woods and lakes. The small towns up here are pretty weird in a distinctly NJ way. The City of Newark owns an enormous amount of undeveloped property in this area, which is operated as a watershed, and is open to recreational uses, but since the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corp. is currently in federal bankruptcy court, following a corruption scandal that briefly threatened to tarnish the good name of NJ Senator Corey Booker [1], the future of this area is somewhat uncertain. One imagines subdivisions; one hopes that one is wrong.

A long history of industry reveals itself in the presence of mill towns throughout the highlands, such as Dover and Butler. I’ve heard that Dover supports a sizeable Columbian immigarant community. Like in New England, these are old towns which owe their out-of-the way locations to the use of water power in their oldest industries. There are also some mining towns, like Franklin, even though the mining has moved on to other poorer parts of the world.

The Highlands are rich in small lakes. Many of these have vacation houses on them. I would DIE for one of these houses.

Of coruse, sprawl has urbanized the character of Highlands culture. There are many examples of formerly out-of-the-way rural roads now lined with fairly conventional suburban houses. McMansions are everywhere - and who can blame all of these urbanites for wanting a nice house in the woods, in a convenient location? A characteristic feature of travel in the region is the sudden transition from a familiar suburban landscape to a relic of an older and weirder past - a purple corugated metal house on a back road with a purple minivan in the driveway, old mining equipmen in the woods, and things like that. Driving around Lake Hopatcong for example, one notices typical suburban houses perched on boulders, and with bare rock instead of grass in their yards.
