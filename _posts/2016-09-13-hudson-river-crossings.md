The Holland and Lincoln tunnels, the PATH tubes, the NJ Transit/Amtrak Tunnel, and the NY Waterway ferry system all cross the Hudson. These tunnels and boats are insufficient to handle the daily traffic across the river in their current state of repair. Tunnel traffic and NJ transit delays are legendary. PATH delays and service interruptions are also an annoyance, though a les poetic one.

The unpredictable, logistically trecharous Hudson River crossing is a daily fact of life for many New Jersey residents. Equally frustrating to people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and walks of life, it is an especially conspicuous weakpoint in many otherwise cushy elite suburban lives. Allow me to present some facts about NJ Transit, without commentary, and let the reader try to figure out for themselves what is going on:

-	Fares on their communter rail lines between suburban towns and Penn Station, NY add up to several hundred dollars per month per passenger
-	They receive extensive state subsidies
-	They recently reduced service while raising their fares
-	They fail to provide reliable service to Penn Station: delays and train cancellations are frequent.

The Hudson River rail tunnels are 80 years old, and were damaged during "Superstorm" Sandy. They can't be repaired, unfortunatly, becuase taking them out of regular use for any amount of time would paralyze the daily commute, and set off a cascade of unthinkable economic effects throughout the region. We tried to build a second tunnel a couple of years ago, but apparently we're not capable of following through on a big construction project like that. The money "saved" by cancelling that project was transferred to the Port Authority, which, if I'm not mistaken, is a fancy way of saying the mob.

Tunnel traffic has more of an inevitable feeling to it, because highway systems all over America and the world have the same problem, and in fact other American cities have it worse. However, NJ's old infrastructure, aggressive drivers, and political problems associated with public works projects add a distinctive kind of charm. To sit dozing in the relative safety of a bus and watch drivers compete for position in the do-or-die merge at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel at 9 AM is a special kind of entertainment.

A NJ suburbanite who works in Manhattan recently described his commute to me as his ''pennance.'' This comment is extraordinarily revealing about the New Jersey character. We ascribe a personal dimension to the anxiety, anger, disappointment, and deadening unpleasantness of the commute. Viewing it as deserved punishment may be the only way to make the suffering make sense. The religious turn of phrase demonstrates the spiritual quality we derive from engagement with our state.

A massive multi-modal bridge crossing about a mile north of the Lincoln Tunnel was planned in the early 20th century but never built. The magnitude of the lost economic opportunity here should give NJ taxpayers pause.

A few good things about our Hudson crossings:

-	<b>The helix at the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel:</b> A full 360 degree spiral of highway, which quickly drops the roadway from the crest of the Palisades, down to the tunnel entrance at water level, and further, once underground, below the river bottom. It is an interesting-looking structure, with sweeping views the harbor widening out into New York Bay. At a certain spot towards the top of the helix, the line of sight is just right so that you can see straight down 34th st, across the river.
-	<b>The PATH tubes </b>have intriguing, ancient-seeming twists and turns. On the train ride, there are always sudden changes in speed, as though the route is difficult to drive, as well as strange sounds and mysterious sights out thew indow.
-	<b>New York Waterway: </b>A ferry services has several routes making various stops on both sides of the river. Incredibly enough, this service supports itself off of its earnings - the only way of crossing Hudson River which does not rely on public funds. The sad part is that the tickets are expensive: something like $6 just to get ferried one-way across the river. Ferries are the oldest way of crossing the river, and given the state of NJ's rail and highway infrastructure, they may be the way of the future as well.
