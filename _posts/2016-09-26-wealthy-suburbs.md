This is the cultural ethos in which my own personal consciousness emerged. Millburn, the town I grew up in, is the second wealthiest municipality in the state at the time of writing, measured by average annual income. There's no denying that money matters, and life in a place like this is going to be different from life in most towns.

Wealth is complicated, though. Many of the wealthiest Millburnites whose kids I knew growing up live simple lives centered around hard work and family. They have intense jobs very near the beating heart of global capitalism: they're lawyers and investment bankers running the machinery behind elaborate business deals and financial transactions in order to please the shareholders of our most treasured companies. They don't have a lot of time or energy left to enjoy their money. Despite generally having good educations, it wouldn't be accurate to call them the cultural elite.

It's a strange situation, because clearly some sacrifice has been made here for the sake of money, sometimes surpassing the banker or lawyer's ability to justify that sacrifice. I find it understandable when the wealthy suburbanite in question seems to have a compelling desire for wealth: maybe their family struggled with poverty and they are driven to give their children comfort and security beyond the wildest dreams of their parents, or maybe they come from a part of the world on the very fringes of capitalism, and they are proud to prove that wealth is possible for their people. But in reality, many - I'm tempted to say most - clawed their way to the top from the somewhat less dramatic starting point of comfortable white collar families. Of course, one cannot help but ponder the influence of simple greed in these career decisions, but close observation has led me to believe that many of these folks are simply smart, hardworking people who did made all the "right" choices in life and took advantage of the opportunities available to them. It is not at all uncommon for them to come to deeply regret their life choices but feel powerless to change them, just like so many others among the American middle class!
 
When fumbling around for a justification for one's life choices, family tends to be a convenient and relatively admirable one. Ensuring that one's kids have every advantage in life, every opportunity for cultural enrichment, and every chance to succeed in the world in whatever way they choose is not the worst underlying motivation. However past a baseline level of financial stability, good parenting and the earning and spending of money become increasingly divergent pursuits. It is the opposing view, though, shared by many wealthy suburbanites, that keeps the proprietors of various camps and enrichment programs, the vendors in our malls, the trustees of our private colleges, and certain Manhattan and Brooklyn landlords all very happy. 

Another ex post facto justification is a very depressing, empty kind of hedonism based on spending lots of money. It's the whole mansion/sports car/conspicuous consumption type of life. It's one thing to have a mansion and a sports car, but another if the fact that you have these things is an essential part of how you think of yourself.

These people may have a lot of money but to a large extent they have been unable to buy their way out of the hustle.

<h2>Public Schools</h2>

One pretty solid reason to live in the wealthy suburbs is that they tend to have good public schools. Academic quality in these towns is related to wealth directly through property tax revenue, and indirectly through the achievement-oriented culture that tends to go hand in hand with the lifestyle here.  

<h2>Innocence</h2>

I struggle with this. I try to take the perspective of "the people" and describe New Jersey in a way that is relatable to everyone, but really I've lived the wealthy suburban lifestyle, and have benefitted from money and social connectedness at every stage of my life. When I talk to someone from, say East Orange, it's hard for us to relate on a genuinely populist level, much as I want to.

Studying the Humanities at a leading liberal arts college without worrying about what I was going to do after, for instance, is in part what makes it possible for me to write with this tone. Also my life is colored by a feeling of detachment, and an awareness that the life choices I make don't really matter, because I always have something (however depressing) to fall back on.

I bring all of this up to offer an example of that strong desire, extremely common in the wealthy suburbs, to identify with the "average American." It seems to be psychologically difficult for us to acknowledge that the conditions of our lives have been fundamentally shaped by the wealth and privilege we have.

There is some substance to the firm middle class identity of the wealthy suburbanites. As I said, the lifestyle is really a lot about work. There is not necessarily that much leisure time. The suburbs are not centers of high culture like the cities, or extensive recreation like they mythical NJ Horse Country. 

Still that doesn't explain why many of us have difficulty accepting that we can do things in our lives that most people simply don't have the freedom to.
