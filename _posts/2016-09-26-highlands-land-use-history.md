As explained on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/land/highlands/highlands-geomorphology.html">Geomorphology of the Highlands</a> page, the edge of the Wisconsin glaciation resulted in dramatically different surficial geology between the northern and southern Highlands.

In the southern Highlands, much less effected by the glaciers, soil is relatively deep, and most areas, except for steep slopes, were cleared for agriculture. Cleared areas include both the fertile valleys and the wide flat ridgetops. In the 19th century, this area seemed to support a traditional agrarian economy and population. Much later, in the late 20th century, when developers became interested in the region, it was already cleared and ready for sprawl to be quickly and inexpensively built.

In the northern Highlands, however, thin and rocky soil, as well as rugged topography, made farming prohibitively difficult. A good portion of the land was probably never cleared for pasture, and remained generally uninhabited. The land was, however, disturbed in other ways. The bedrock's mineral richness made for an extensive mining industry, dating from the 18th century until the 20th. Iron was mined here for the Revolutionary War. The Sterling Hill Mine, a huge zinc mine in Ogdensberg, operated for 200 years, until the 1980s. It's now an incredibly cool museum. Forests were cleared for charcoal to fuel furnaces for smelting, and other industrial uses, before the era of fossil fuels. Mining towns once thrived throughout the region but dried up as mining industries moved elsewhere.

Numerous mountain streams became the sites of industrial mill towns, with Dover probably being the biggest.

Much of the land hasn't found much use in the modern world. A lot of it has become public land â€” state forests and parks, plus the enormous Newark Watershed property. Much of the land is now managed for recreation. An upshot of this underutilization is that much of it is now covered with mature hardwood forest. Today, the forestry industry in New Jersey is very small, so a lot of these trees are probably going to grow for a while.

It's a lot more expensive to develop steep, rocky areas with thin soils and dense forest cover than cropland and pastures, so believe it or not, I think nature put a speed bump in the path of encroaching sprawl in the northern Highlands. You will see recent housing devlopments here, but they're isolated.
