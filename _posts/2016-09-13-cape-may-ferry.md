What happens to the Garden State Parkway when it gets to the bottom of New Jersey, Exit 1? The tailbone at the base of the spine, if you will?

As if unphased by the land's subsidence beneath the waters of Delaware Bay, the Parkway's engineers direct vehicles to board a car ferry. The ferry crosses the entire bay, disgorging its human and vehicular cargo at Lewis, Deleware, just west of Cape Henlopen.

Unfortunately for travellers from all but the southernmost counties of NJ, it is faster to access Delaware and points south by crossing the comparatively boring — though still beautiful — Delaware Memorial Bridge, via the NJ Turnpike. However I've always wanted to take the Cape May-Lewis Ferry, just for fun.
