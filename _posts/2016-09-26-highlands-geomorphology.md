The NJ Highlands bring some of the real bowels of the earth to the surface. The story of its resilient bedrock of granite, gneiss, amphibolite and all kinds of crazy stuff can be traced back over a billion years, and features by so many different earth processes at differnt points in the planet’s history that Geologists admit to being overwhelmed. A USGS authority concludes, “faults and bedrock structures in the Highlands region have exceedingly complex histories that are challenging to discern” [1].

The region’s mineral richness is evident in the historical significance of mining - from colonial era iron mines to the Sterling Hill zinc mine, a massive Zinc operation which lasted until the 1980’s in Ogsdenberg (and now gives amazing tours). The geography is rugged, although the relief is too low to really consider the area mountainous. The glaciers made it about halfway down, and as a general rule areas north of Route 80 were glaciated, while areas south escaped. Bedrock is hella exposed on some glaciated ridgetops and hilltops. It is no coincidence that the majority of NJ’s good hiking destinations are in the northern part of the highlands.

Most of the region is too rocky and steep to be well-suited for agriculture, but there are a few fertile valleys. These are areas of Cambrian age limestone and dolomite, interspersed with the Precambrian highlands along a series of faults. Many of these valleys are extensively planted with corn at present. The valleys are concentrated in the southern portion of the region, just north of Route 78, with the ruggedness and elevation of the uplands increasing as one travels north.
