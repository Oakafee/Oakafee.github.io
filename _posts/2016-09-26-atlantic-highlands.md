Hartshorne Woods County Park encompasses a range of steep hills, surrounded by saltwater bays and estuaries on three sides: the Raritan Bay to the north, the Shrewsbury River to the east, and the Navesink River to the south. The location is remarkable for its immediate proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, along NJ's generally flat coastline. To the east, only the Shrewsbury River and a narrow strip of barrier island at Sea Bright separate the these uplands from the breakers. The hills are part of the Atlantic Highlands, geologically within NJ's coastal plain. Like the rest of the coastal plain, they are composed ocean sediments whose deposition was a relatively recent time when the sea level was higher. In the Atlantic Highlands, an erosion-resistant layer of ironstone underlies the higher slopes and hilltops. The formation of ironstone is a very cool process, turning ordinary sedimentary rocks into a very hard material long after their original deposition, but it's beyond the scope of this website. The iron content in these hills was never enough for them to be commerically mined. Ironstone underlies some of the other hills on the coastal plain, but none as steep or as close to the ocean as these in Hartshorne Woods County Park.

Long, steep slopes of tulip poplar and mixed oaks, with a dense understory of holly in places, interface directly with the saltwater bayshore of the Navesink river. Those slopes facing the Raritan Bay and the Shrewsbury River may also have had similar vegetation, but they are now developed. The hilltops are crowned in many places with an extensive mountain laurel understory, including some very tall, old, beautiful individuals. In some small inland valleys, northern hardwood trees such as sweet birch (and even some paper birch, possibly a landscaping escapee) become common. To walk through these hills of mature hardwood forest and look down at the Atlantic Ocean stretching out to the horizon is, in the author's perspective, exquisite.
