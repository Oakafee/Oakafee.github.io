Slavery was a part of 17th and 18th century NJ society, and many slaves of African ancestry as well as free blacks lived in NJ in colonial times.

In the modern era, cities such as Newark seem to always have had black communities. The Great Migration from the South caused the black populations of NJ's industrial cities to grow exponentially between WWI and the 60s, with profound effects on local and regional politics.

In more recent decades, Afro-Caribbean immigration has been substantial, mostly to these same cities.

Deeply entrenched racism has interfered with the suburban drift of black New Jerseyites, a topic I treat at greater length elsewhere on this website. One upshot of residential segregation is the existence of a fair number of predominantly black suburbs. In the Newark area these include East Orange, Irvington, Hillside and neighborhoods of Union and Maplewood.
