Slavery was a part of 17th and 18th century New Jersey society, and many slaves of African ancestry as well as free blacks lived in New Jersey in colonial times.

In the modern era, cities such as Newark seem to always have had black communities. The Great Migration from the South caused the black populations of NJ's industrial cities to grow exponentially between WWI and the 60's, with profound effects on local and regional politics.

In more recent decades, Afro-Caribbean immigration has been substantial, mostly to these same cities.

Deeply entrenched racism has interfered with the suburban drift of black New Jerseyites, a topic I will treat at greater length in the History of the Suburbs area of this website.  One upshot of residential segregation is the existence of a fair number of predominantly black suburbs. In the Newark area these include East Orange, Irvington, Hillside, and neighborhoods of Union and Maplewood.
