The Highlands are mountainous but on a very small scale. It is cool to see the forest change rapidly and dramatically as you go uphill. Everywhere is rocky, and many of the valleys are strewn with boulders, but there are numerous small bottomland areas with deep, moist soil. Huge tulip trees, white ashes, and white oaks can be found in some of these spots. I've also often noticed sub-canopy trees like musclewood and hophornbeam as well as spicebush in the shrub layer.

Many little mountain streams, which often go dry by the end of the season, drain the rocky hills. By these streams, beech, yellow birch, and sugar maple predominate. Sugar maple also tends to climb up the lower slopes of the hills, where there is still consistent moisture, seeming to thrive especially in the boulder piles immediately below big ledges of exposed bedrock.

Along the larger streams and on the cool, moist slopes by lakes, rhododendron is a conspicuously presence. A beautiful site to see, for sure, but not nearly as widespread as it is in Pennsylvania or West Virginia. Rhododendron is locally very abundant on the mountainside above Surprise Lake on Bearfort Mountain. It's one of the hiking gems of NJ. I've tried and failed to come here at the right time to see them all blooming. 

So many trails in the Highlands, crossing a stream and climbing up a slope, take you on a quick tour of the transition from wet to dry forest. Uphill from stream valleys, red oak, sweet birch, and hickory start to take over from the maples and beeches. You also see a fair number of persimmon trees. Hophornbeam, musclewood and witch hazel are common underneath the canopy of better sites in this mixed hardwood forest. Moving up the slope, if there's enough soil, mountain laurel often forms a dense understory.

The dry upland forest that covers much of upper slopes and hilltops of the Highlands consists of mostly "mixed oaks," with chestnut oak predominating on rocky ground. You'll also see various hickories occasionally mixed in. Blueberries are an extremely widespread understory plant in this type of community. However, in many places in the region there is little to no soil covering the bedrock on the higher slopes and hilltops, and you're really not even in a closed-canopy forest anymore: it's trees finding whatever spots they can between rocks to grow. Grass fills in a lot of the gaps up here, and in some places it looks like a savannah. In the spots that happen to have more moisture, deeper soils, and better protection, you'll see some interesting shrubs like serviceberry.

Around exposed bedrock at the tops of hills, you'll often find scrub oak, very beautiful and distinctive red cedar, and sometimes pitch pine. Some cool sun-loving, drought-tolerant herbaceous plants can be seen growing on the soils that are too thin for trees. I've seen prickly pear cactus and fragrant mountain mint on the side of Windbeam Mountain, for instance.
