Like many of New Jersey's most interesting places, Sandy Hook has a distinctly weird vibe. It used to house a military base, Fort Hancock, whose gun batteries stood ready to defend New York Harbor against naval invasions, until our post-war reliance on air power and nuclear weapons rendered such operations quaint. Today Fort Hancock's buildings slowly decay under the management of the National Park Service, which administers the sandy peninsula (or hook) as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area.

The people of New Jersey now come to this former fortress on summer weekends for Atlantic bathing. Indeed, it is the northernmost beach of the Jersey Shore. "Sandy Hook Parking Lot Full" is a familiar message spotted along the Garden State Parkway on the route to NJ's beach towns.

Though I'm not a surfer, it is my understanding that bathymetric or coastal conditions are especially favorable to surf conditions at a particular, well-known spot at Sandy Hook.

The New York City skyline is visible across Raritan Bay from the beach here, in a beautiful view that juxtaposes the wilderness of the ocean with the center of global capitalism. Many New Jerseyites traditionally question the cleanness of Sandy Hook's waters for swimming, citing its proximity to highly industrialized areas along the Raritan and New York Harbor, sewage disposal areas, and reported observances of hypodermic needles washed up on shore. While these concerns most certainly were valid in the mid 20th century, one can only hope that environmental protection laws, the decline of industry in our region and advances in sewage treatment technology have lessened the risk.
