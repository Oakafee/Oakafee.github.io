Like many of New Jersey's most interesting places, Sandy Hook has a distinctly weird vibe. It used to house a military base, Fort Hancock, whose gun batteries stood ready to defend New York Harbor against naval invasions, until our post-war reliance on air power and nuclear weapons rendered such operations quaint. Today Fort Hancock's buildings slowly decay under the management of the National Park Service, which administers the sandy peninsula (or hook) as part of the Gateway National Recreation Area.

The people of New Jersey now come to this former fortress on summer days for Atlantic bathing. Indeed, it is the northernmost beach of the Jersey Shore. "Sandy Hook Parking Lot Full" is a familiar message spotted along the Garden State Parkway en route to NJ's beach towns on hot summer weekends. Camping is available here too.

Though I'm not a surfer, it is my understanding that bathymetric or coastal conditions are especially favorable to surf conditions at some particular, well-known spot at Sandy Hook.

The New York City skyline is visible across Raritan Bay from the beach here, in a beautiful vista that juxtaposes the wilderness of the ocean with the center of global capitalism. Many New Jerseyites traditionally question the cleanness of Sandy Hook's waters for swimming, citing its proximity to highly industrialized areas along the Raritan and New York Harbor, sewage disposal areas, and reported locations of hypodermic needles washed up along the shore. While these concerns most certainly were valid in the mid 20th century, one can only hope that environmental protection laws, the decline of industry in our region and advances in sewage treatment technology have lessened the risk.

Sandy Hook is a long sandbar connected to the mainland by a narrow strip reinforced with a concrete and stone seawall. The peninsula widens to the north, and is covered with a scrubby forest composed mostly of holly. This is the only area I've ever seen holly as a canopy tree, and here it is dominant everywhere. Pitch Pine, which one might expect on a barrier island, does not seem to be especially common.
