West Orange stretches across a broad swath of Essex County but lacks a coherent downtown. It encompasses everything from a slice of urban area, by its eastern border with Orange, to newly built, spread out suburbs west of the Watchung Mountains. Its suburbs are of a more middle class character compared with the adjacent wealthy towns of Millburn and Livingston, and there numerous and extensive condo complexes. Some of the condos are actually still being carved out of remaining tracts of undeveloped woodland as I'm writing this.

The portions of the township west of the Watchung Mountains developed later than other nearby areas because the long, steep ridge served as barrier to 19th century railroad construction. Train lines were routed through the major gaps in the ridge: one at Millburn few miles south, and another at Montclair a few miles north, but none within West Orange. Interstate 280, built in the 60's, was able to pass through the mountain just fine, though, thanks to a huge road cut that exposes some very cool hexagonally shaped columnar joints in the bassalt bedrock. Much of the suburban housing stock of West Orange is post-war, similar to Livingston. 

Among a Jerseyesque variety of ethnicities, the area is home to a large Jewish-American population. It is tempting to say that not since the destruction of the Temple have the Jewish people experienced such a secure, organic connection to a piece of land as they do in this part of the state. Jewish culture flourishes here, and numerous synagogues of varying levels of architectural tastefulness dot the suburban streets.

My grandparents lived for a while in one of West Orange's many condo complexes: Eagle Ridge. It was located on Prospect Avenue across from the Essex Green Shopping Center (not a full-blown indoor NJ mall, but more of a huge overgrown strip mall) on the top of an actual ridge: the crest of the first Watchung Mountain. Their unit was at the eastern edge of the property, and was separated by a small field and a fence from the I-280 road cut - a sheer cliff probably at least 100 feet tall. The view to the east over 280 was stunning, encompassing much of urban NJ and the Manhattan skyline. Also, radio transmission towers on the ridgetop just south of the condo complex excited me as a kid with their blinking lights. However it was the view west from Prospect Ave., over the Essex Green Shopping Center towards the house-covered hilltops of the Second Watchung Mountain, that tended to suggest to me the hidden richness of life. This vantage point, and traveling through the area in general, inspired in me a powerful spiritual longing that I still hope to understand and follow someday.

A pharmaceutical company, Organon, had a massive facility on Mount Pleasant Avenue, but abandoned it in 2004, stating that "we have valued the contributions that Organon employees at the West Orange facility have made during their careers." The buildings now seem to be divided up into various medical offices.
