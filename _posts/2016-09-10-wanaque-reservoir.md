A steep, rocky valley between the Ramapo Mountains to the east and the Wyanoke Plateau to the west was dammed in several different places to create the Wanaque Reservoir, which serves as a water supply for somehwere, I know not where.

I-287 provides an excellent view of of the reservoir, between its junctions with I-80 and I-87, with rocky hills rising from its shores on all sides. 

West Brook Road, probably one of the more scenic roads in NJ, crosses the Wanaque Reservoir at a narrow point. Many great NJ hiking destinations are visible from this bridge, though it's inadvisable to stop your car.

You can get great views of the reservor at High Point in Norvin Green State Forest, Windbeam Mountain along the Stonetown Circular Trail, and some spots in the Ramapos.
