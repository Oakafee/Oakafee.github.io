Part of the larger Sedimentary Appalachian region, which extends north to NY State, west to Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, and south to Georgia and Alabama. 

The Kittatinny Ridge, home to the Delaware Water Gap, High Point, and other notable mountain features of NJ, is part of a long stripe of ridgeline that continues more or less uninterrupted from some of West Virginia's most dramatic mountain features, through MD, PA and NJ, and up to the Shawangunk Mountains in New York's Hudson Valley. The ridge is formed by a very hard, erosion-resistant layer, varying from sandstone to conglomerate, deposited by eroding ancient Taconic Mountains.

The valley element of the region is part of the Great Valley of the Appalachians, which connects with Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. The NJ section supports some dairy farms and cornfields. 

This is a fairly rural region, and I am not sure why exurban developers seem to have tread more lightly here than in the Pocono region of Pennsylvania just to the west, across the Delaware.
