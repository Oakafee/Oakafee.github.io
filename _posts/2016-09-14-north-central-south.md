## North Jersey

My own native land. Like Central Jersey, it is overwhelmingly influenced by the adjacent city of New York, but it also shares some characteristics with the neighboring Hudson Valley and nearby New England. The wealthiest and probably the most pretentious of the Jerseys, North Jersey houses many important figures in New York's culture and economy during the night and weekend hours. 

## Central Jersey

The Jersiest of the Jersies, by popular consensus. It spans the southern half of NYC's metro area.

## South Jersey

Who even knows what's going on here.
