The Passaic is the major river of Northeastern NJ. Its historical importance to the region's economy is incalculable, mostly thanks to its massive waterfall in Paterson. Though it isn't the biggest river in NJ, it's the only one with a county named after it.

It flows in a very complicated shape from the Highlands, around the Watchung Mountains, and into Newark Bay:

The extensive wetlands (shown in dark green) that surround the Passaic River upstream of its waterfalls at Paterson and Little Falls are a very rich ecosystem. They are a patchwork of different ecological communities including marshes, open grassy meadows, extensive swampy bottomland forests dominated by black gum, pin oak, and silver maple, and isolated bits of lush upland forest of beech, red maple, red oak and other local species. Birdwatching in these areas is amazing. When I was younger I used to love seeing the turtles at the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.

This swampland - from the Great Swamp to Troy Meadows to Great Piece Meadows - constitutes a huge chunk of undeveloped land right in the middle of suburbia. Though there were plans to drain the Great Swamp and build an airport during the 60's, I would surmise that the reason this area remains undeveloped today is the difficulty of building on such soggy, flood-prone ground. Visiting one of these areas, the New Jerseyite's romantic imagination can run wild with images of how the whole region used to look in the days before sprawl.

<h2>Tributaries</h2>

Several significant streams of the NJ Highlands empty into the Passaic during its swampy stretch, making it especially mighty once it descends the Great Falls.

The <b>Whippany River </b>is apparently a fast-moving fishing stream in the Morris County highlands, but it then passes under I-287 and enters the swamps at Troy Meadows, where it seems to get lost.

The <b>Rockaway River</b> drains a fair portion of Morris County's Highlands before cascading dramatically down through Boonton, in the vicinity of the Ramapo Fault, where the Highlands and the Piedmont meet. A fast-moving section is visible from I-287 just below Boonton. Historically, the Rockaway provided power for mill towns such as Dover.

The <b>Pompton River, </b> the most important tributary of the Passaic, is the result of a combination of three cool rivers of the Highlands. The Pequannock cuts a dramatic valley that runs northwest deep into the state. Scenic Route 23 and a railroad (not part of NJ transit's system) follow its course through some of NJ's most rugged territory. It forms the boundary between Morris County and the upper portion of Passaic County. The Wanaque River drains some of NJ's best hiking country, including Greenwood Lake and the Wanaque Reservoir. The Ramapo River, which rises far to the north in the Ramapo Mountains of New York, flows south along the NY Thruway and through Bergen County. These three add quite a bit of volume to the Passaic, at its junction with the Pompton just above Little Falls.

The lower tributaries are smaller, suburban streams which I know less about: Bergen County's Saddle River, which joins in the city of Passaic, and Second River, which drains some of eastern Essex County.

<h2>Great Falls</h2>

Well, what can I even say?
