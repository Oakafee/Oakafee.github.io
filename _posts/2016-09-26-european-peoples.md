The Dutch, not the British, hold the dubious distinction of being the first white conquerors of New Jersey. However it is when the British in turn conquered the Dutch's Nieuw Amsterdam that the political entity of New Jersey was first given form. 

Germans and Irish had a big impact on New Jersey, arriving throughout the 19th century.

Towards the end of the 19th century, immigration restrictions were lifted to allow people from Southern and Eastern Europe to enter in large numbers. Italians, mostly from poor areas in southern Italy, and Jews from Poland, Russia, and the politically ambiguous area in between them poured into NJ, plus smaller but substantial numbers of Poles, Slovaks, Greeks and other nationalities from those regions. Anti-immigration legislation in the 1920's majorly reduced the flow.

More recently, Portuguese, Russian and Ukranian immigration have continued to bring Europeans to NJ.

If there is one ethnic group that has set the cultural tone of NJ (aside, of course, from the British), I'd have to say it's been the Italians.
