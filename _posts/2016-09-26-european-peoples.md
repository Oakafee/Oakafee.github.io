The Dutch, not the British, hold the dubious distinction of being the first white conquerors of New Jersey. However it is when the British in turn conquered the Dutch's Nieuw Amsterdam that the political entity of New Jersey was first given form. 

Germans and Irish had a big impact on New Jersey, arriving throughout the 19th century.

Towards the end of the 19th century, immigration restrictions were lifted to allow people from Southern and Eastern Europe to enter in large numbers. Italians, mostly from poor areas in southern Italy, and Jews from Poland, Russia, and the politically ambiguous area in between them poured into NJ, plus smaller but substantial numbers of Poles, Slovaks, Greeks and other nationalities from those regions. Anti-immigration legislation in the 1920's majorly reduced the flow. But at that point, it was too late. The age of Anglo-Saxon dominance of New Jersey was fast waning.

Mid 20th century prosperity and White Flight, about which we will have much more to say, largely transformed these "white ethnic" groups from city-dwellers to subarbanites, and indeed today their descendants are some of the most emdemically suburban populations in the metropolis. Even as ethnic distinctions began to dissolve in the warm embrace of White America, these groups have to some extent maintained separate, cohesive identities. It is still possible to identify an NJ town as a Jewish suburb or an Italian suburb, for instance. On a personal note, my town, Millburn was a textbook example of a Jewish suburb. Italian-American, Irish-American, WASPy, and other white families certainly lived there and felt just as much at home there, but they were decisively outnumbered by Jews. There were also plenty of Chinese- and Indian-American families who thrived in the town, but I do think they faced subtle kinds of discrimination. 

More recently, Portuguese, Russian and Ukranian immigration have continued to bring Europeans to NJ's cities and suburbs.

If there is one ethnic group that has set the cultural tone of NJ (aside, of course, from the British), I'd have to say it's been the Italians.
