<p>Any writing or other media you want to send me, related to any aspect of NJ, will be posted - I promise. I mean, unless it's illegal or something. </p>

<h2>Simply send to jefrttt (at) gmail.com </h2>

<p>This website is the work of a variety of contributors, each with their own perspective on NJ. My attitude is that including different points of view can only possibly advance our cause of comprehensively understanding our state. </p>

<p>Please, don't be shy. Anything is valid. Can be as long or short, personal or general, abstract or practical, as you want. </p>
