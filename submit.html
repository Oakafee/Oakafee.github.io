<p>The goal of this website is to synthesize as comprehensive, realistic, and beautiful an account of our state as possible. This is a task to wich the editors alone are unequal. Our vision relies on your contributions. You can read more about the site's purpose on the <a href="http://interpretation-of-nj.com/why.html">Why</a> page. </p>

<p>I have almost no standards, and I mean that as a good thing. Your contribution could be a personal story about something that happened to you. Or a memory or an observation. Or of course if you want to write a long historical analysis of some aspect of NJ's society up to the highest scholarly standards, then great. I will post everything, just as long as it has something to do with New Jersey and isn't horribly offensive in some way.  </p>

<p>Thank you, and enjoy. </p>
