Any writing or other media you want to send me, related to any aspect of NJ, will be posted - I promise. I mean, unless it's illegal or something.

## Simply send to jefrttt (at) gmail.com

This website is the work of a variety of contributors, each with their own perspective on NJ. My attitude is that including different points of view can only possibly advance our cause of comprehensively understanding our state.

Please, don't be shy. Anything is valid. Can be as long or short, personal or general, abstract or practical, as you want.
