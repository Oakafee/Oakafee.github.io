New Jersey is a fundamentally suburban state. Its cities contain their fair share of grassy lawns. However they are overshadowed by innumerable smaller, generally wealthier, municipalities that surround them. 

Much ill can and will be spoken about the suburbs. However, it must be disclaimed that this is my home. Kepe in mind that the judgements I may make them can never be completely disentangled from my own sense of self-worth. Suburban comfort infects the very core of my soul. The image of a orange clouds blowing past bare branches of tall oak trees on a winter night, with a row of quiet houses below, is instantly and inherently compelling to my mind, perhaps moreso than my strongest moral conviction. These drivers of black Escalades, voracious consumers of SAT prep materials, daily wearers of high performance ski jackets, are my cousins, my brothers and sisters, myself.

...There is a distinctly suburban torpor which results from the tendency of physical comfort to sooth feelings of moral and psychological discomfort. Many bright, educated, well-meaning people are lulled to sleep by the comfort of their daily life here.
